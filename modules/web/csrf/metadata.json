    "explanation": "Exploit the CSRF vulnerability to perform an unauthorized action on behalf of an authenticated user.",
    "steps": [
      "Navigate to /csrf and observe the transfer form",
      "Notice there's no CSRF token validation",
      "Create an HTML page with a malicious form that auto-submits",
      "Trick an authenticated user into visiting your page",
      "The transfer will execute without user consent",
      "Capture the flag from the response"
    ],

    "hints": [
      "CSRF attacks exploit the trust a website has in a user's browser",
      "Look for state-changing operations without CSRF protection",
      "The form submission doesn't validate the request origin"
